# Fibrations symmetries on Julia

Implementation in Julia for the fast fibration partitioning (FFP) algorithm on directed networks. The algorithm is presented 
in the paper of *Monteiro et. al.* (link for the draft to be available soon). In this paper we use the codes in this repo for
proper perfomance comparison between the FFP algorithm and other common methods for the identification of fibration symmetries.
Here, we give general guidance on how to obtain the fibration partitioning, or minimal balanced coloring, of any directed network
parsed through a CSV file.

Fibration symmetries in context of complex networks are introduced in the recent work of [Morone et. al.](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/15/8306).

## Importing

To use the julia package of name 'FastFibration' in the command line, it is necessary first to access the package command line
of julia (accessed via ']' in the julia REPL) and use the following command inside the `fast_fibration/` folder: 
```julia
pkg> activate .
julia> using FastFibration
```
The activate command above is not necessary if the package is used in jupyter notebooks.

## Usage 

To find the fibration partitioning of a given directed network it is necessary only the information of the network structure (nodes and edges)
and the types of each edge (in case the edges are multidimensional). For this, the network must be parsed as an **CSV file** following the structure
of an edgelist containing two essential informations (source and target) and one optional information (the type of the edge for multiplex scenarios). 
For instance, let us consider the graph below where the edges can assume two possible values: 'positive' or 'negative'.

The edgefile for this graph, called `net.csv` should follow the format below:

> Source,Target,Type<br/>
> 1,2,positive<br/>
> 2,1,positive<br/>
> 3,1,positive<br/>
> 3,4,positive<br/>
> 4,2,negative<br/>
> 4,3,positive<br/>
> 4,5,positive<br/>
> 6,3,negative<br/>
> 7,4,negative<br/>
> 8,6,positive<br/>
> 8,7,positive<br/>

In this file, the third column refers to the possible values of each edge. There is no restriction on the specific
format of its values as long as each different string represent a different edge type. For the first (source) and 
second (target) columns the node labels must be inside the interval \[1,N\] where N is the total number of nodes in
the graph.

Thus, to extract the fibers of the network provided by this edgefile, we run the 
following

```julia
    graph = FastFibration.graph_from_csv("path/to/edgefile", true)
    fiber_partition = FastFibration.fast_fibration(graph)
    number_nontrivial_fibers, total_fibers, fiber_map = FastFibration.extract_fiber_groups(fiber_partition)
```

Where `fiber_partition` is a container or array holding `Fiber` structures. To access the nodes belonging to a specific fiber, we can check `.nodes`, like in `fiber_partition[1].nodes` for the first element of the container returned. To get the information about the number of fibers, total number of partition 
elements and which nodes inside each `partition` element, we can use the results obtained from `extract_fiber_groups` function, which returns the number of fibers containing more than one node (nontrivial), the total number of fibers (including single node fibers) and a julia dictionary `fiber_map`. The dictionary 
`fiber_map` has as keys the indexes of `fiber_partition` and as values the array of node labels belonging to each fiber of `fiber_partition`.

## Tests

In the folder `fast_fibration/data/` there are 7 seven different networks which provides basic example networks to test the code. All these files represent 
simple circuits on which is easy to check the correctness of the algorithm, with exception the file `test_Ecoli.csv`, which represents the main dataset used
in the previous work of [Morone et. al.](https://www.pnas.org/content/117/15/8306).
